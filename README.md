# Morse Code Translator 
*Look at the functionality not the design, I ain't a designer*

## Text To Morse
Type the text you want to translate into morse code,
Rules:
 - Only add alphabet, both uppercase and lower case allowed
 - Numbers are allowed (0-9)
 - Rest all characters such as special symbols, puntuation marks etc are not allowed and will give an error

## Morse To Text
Type the morse code you want to trnaslate into text.
Rules:
 - Only "." and  "-" are allowed
 - As of now the program can only convert alphabets and number forms of code into text
 - Add __single__ space between individual characters/alphabets and __double__ space between individual words
 - Dont use any special characters/puntuation marks


## On mobile devices
While typing morse code, mobile devices automatically convert 2 "-" put togeather into one single long dash, which is an invalid input for the program and thus, not cool.
This is a user device setting and I can do nothing about it
